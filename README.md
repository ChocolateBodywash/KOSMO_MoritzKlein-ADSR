This should have been my first dip into PCB design but it was my second. It's a pretty straight forward design.

Note: This was created by a hobbyist with no formal engineering training outside various late night YouTube binges. 
I’ve confirmed these designs to work but I make no guarantees on the design working efficiently.. or working at all.
